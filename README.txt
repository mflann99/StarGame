Astronomy 103 Term Project one
All code written by Mick Flannery


This is a game which takes some concepts learns to lecture and applies them to an interactive game. Obviously many of
functions of the game go against how stars work in real life to make an actually playable game. For one thing, stars
typically aren't controlled by arrow keys, and they don't actively seek out hydrogen molecules. I tried to get the 
increase in temperature and the color changes to be as synced up and real as possible, along with the masses, but working
with a moving gradient of rgb colors provided a bit of difficulty.
